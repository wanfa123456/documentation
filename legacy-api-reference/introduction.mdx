title: 'Legacy API'

Previous API versions can be found <a href="https://docs.woox.io/#general-information" target="_self">here.</a>
These APIs are now considered legacy and will be sunset in phases:  
- REST API: scheduled for deprecation on **December 31, 2025**  
- WebSocket API: scheduled for deprecation on **December 31, 2025**  


While these APIs will remain operational until their respective sunset dates, they are no longer actively maintained, and updates or bug fixes may be delayed or unavailable.  

If youâ€™re migrating from an earlier version, please refer to the V3 <a href="../api-reference/guide" target="_self">Integration Guide</a> and <a href="../api-reference/migration_guide" target="_self">Interface Mapping</a> to streamline the transition. We strongly recommend all developers migrate to the latest V3 API for enhanced performance, lower latency, and long-term support.
