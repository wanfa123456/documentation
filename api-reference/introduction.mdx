## Overview
The V3 REST and WebSocket APIs are our latest API offerings for programmatic trading, market data access, and account management.  V3 introduces a unified and standardized interface across spot and perpetual markets, built to offer lower latency, higher reliability, and greater consistency.

## Key upgrades
### REST APIs  
**Clear subpath organization for business logic**  
All V3 REST endpoints follow a structured subpath model for better clarity.  

| Subpath | Purpose | 
|------|------|
| /public | Public market data (no auth needed)   | 
| /trading | Order placement & management   | 
| /account | Account level configurations & data   | 
| /assets | Deposits, withdrawals, token balances   | 
| /futures | Perpetual specific endpoints   | 
| /spotMargin | Spot margin functions   | 

#### Standardized authentication scheme
All V3 REST endpoints follow a unified parameter handling scheme:

- GET and DELETE requests pass parameters through the query string.
- POST and PUT requests send parameters in the JSON-formatted request body.

##### Consistent response format
All V3 REST endpoints follow a standardized response structure.
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data":{ ... },
    "timestamp": 1717507200000
}
```
- success: Boolean indicating API call result

- data: Response payload containing the requested information

- timestamp: Server time in milliseconds (UTC)

#### Consistent field naming
All V3 REST endpoints enforce consistent naming across all product lines to the extent possible, and use camelCase for naming consistency in both request and response bodies.

#### Strong typing discipline
All V3 REST endpoints follow the following typing discipline:

- Decimal fields are returned as strings to prevent precision errors.

- Integer fields use numeric type.

### WebSocket APIs
#### WebSocket architecture rebuilt
The V3 WebSocket infrastructure has been completely rebuilt to deliver a faster, more reliable, and developer-optimized experience. Key improvements include:

- Reduced Latency – Faster data delivery

- Improved Message Throughput - Higher message rates for real-time responsiveness

- Greater Connection Stability – Robust under heavy load and network interruptions

#### More order book depth options for different needs
V3 offers flexible order book depth options with update frequencies tailored to depth levels (50, 200, 500), enabling more efficient and customizable market data streaming.

#### Abbreviated field names
V3 WebSocket payloads use shortened keys (e.g., px for price, sx for size) to reduce message size and I/O overhead.
