### Authentication

<Note>
  Public market data topics do not require authentication.
</Note>




Authentication is required for subscribing to private user data streams (e.g., order updates, account info).

To authenticate:  

1. **Obtain a listen key**  
Call the following <a href="endpoint/account/listen_key" target="_self">endpoint</a> to get your listenKey.

2. **Connect to the WebSocket**  
Use the WebSocket base URL and append your listen key as a query parameter at `{base_wss_url}`?key=`<listenKey>`.

Once connected, you may subscribe to various private topics using subscription commands.  See <a href="endpoint/websocket/subscribe" target="_self">subscription commands</a> for full details.




## Additional information
 ### General
Each WebSocket connection is valid for a maximum of 24 hours.  Expect automatic disconnection at the 24-hour mark.



### Connection limits
A client IP can establish a maximum of 100 connections every 5 minutes.  Exceeding this will result in rejected attempts and a cooldown period.

A client IP can maintain up to 100 active WebSocket connections at any given time.  Any attempt to exceed this will result in new connections being denied.

Note: Extensive retries after hitting limits will result in an IP ban.

### Subscription limits
Each connection can subscribe to a maximum of 100 live topics simultaneously.  Further subscription attempts will be rejected once this limit is reached.

When submitting batch subscriptions, the server processes them sequentially.  If the subscription limit is reached mid-way, the server will accept subscriptions until the limit is met.  Any subscriptions that exceed the limit will be rejected.  The maximum number of topics to subscribe per request is 20.

While subscribing to topics within a single connection, it is not recommended to exceed 200 TPS.

### Ping-Pong mechanism
The server supports a Ping-Pong mechanism for clients to verify connectivity and measure round-trip latency. This is not required for keep-alive purposes.
#### Example
**Client sends:**
```bash
{ "cmd": "PING", "ts": 1750641291182 } 
```
**Server responds:**
```bash
{ "cmd": "PONG", "success": true, "time": 1750641291322 } 
```
