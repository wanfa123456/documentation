### General
Each WebSocket connection is valid for a maximum of 24 hours.  Expect automatic disconnection at the 24-hour mark.

The WebSocket server sends a ping command to the client every 1 minute. If the server does not receive a pong response within 5 minutes, it will disconnect the client.

### Connection limits
A client IP can establish a maximum of 100 connections every 5 minutes.  Exceeding this will result in rejected attempts and a cooldown period.

A client IP can maintain up to 100 active WebSocket connections at any given time.  Any attempt to exceed this will result in new connections being denied.

Note: Extensive retries after hitting limits will result in an IP ban.

### Subscription limits
Each connection can subscribe to a maximum of 100 live topics simultaneously.  Further subscription attempts will be rejected once this limit is reached.

When submitting batch subscriptions, the server processes them sequentially.  If the subscription limit is reached mid-way, the server will accept subscriptions until the limit is met.  Any subscriptions that exceed the limit will be rejected.  The maximum number of topics to subscribe per request is 20.

While subscribing to topics within a single connection, it is not recommended to exceed 200 TPS.
